    <p>Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas, and fossil fuel production is a major source of global methane emissions along with agriculture and waste management.<b>For many years, methane was overlooked in the climate change conversation. But scientists and policymakers are increasingly recognizing that methane reductions are crucial</b>. <i>Slowing today’s unprecedented rate of warming can help avert our most acute climate risks, including crop loss, wildfires, extreme weather and rising sea levels</i>.</p>
    <p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has more than 80<sup>th</sup> times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20<sup>th</sup> years after it reaches the atmosphere. Even though CO<sub>2</sub> has a longer-lasting effect, methane sets the pace for warming in the near term.</p>
    <p>As the world’s largest         oil and gas producer, the United States has both an opportunity and a responsibility to lead the way on reducing methane emissions.</p> <That>Slowing today’s unprecedented <br/> including crop loss, wildfires, extreme weather and rising sea levels.That not only undid one of the Trump administration’s damaging climate<hr/> rollbacks it immediately reinstated critical protections for communities across the country.<strong>Raising awareness</strong>about the scale and impact of methane emissions is essential to developing effective policy.<em>Environmental Protection</em>Agency estimated at the time. The volume represents enough natural gas to fuel 10 million homes.<blockquote>Methane is the simplest of saturated hydrocarbons with a chemical formula.</blockquote> <q>Methane is the simplest of saturated hydrocarbons with a chemical formula </q>
